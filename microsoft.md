# Interview Preparation Guide
(Reference: https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/hiring-tips/technical-interviewing)

This guide is designed to help you prepare for coding interviews, focusing on key concepts and technical areas. Below are the primary topics you should focus on:

## Algorithms

Interviewers often assess your problem-solving approach, and understanding algorithms is essential. Below are the critical points to focus on:

### Recursion
- Recursion is a common technique used in problem-solving. Be sure to understand its application and how to optimize recursive solutions.

### Sorting Algorithms
- **QuickSort**: Average time complexity of O(n log n), but worst-case complexity is O(n^2).
- **Merge Sort**: Always O(n log n) time complexity.
- Understand when to use each sorting algorithm based on the problem context.

### Complexity
- Be prepared to explain the time and space complexity of your algorithms using Big O notation.

## Data Structures

Understanding various data structures and their use cases is critical. Hereâ€™s an overview of common data structures you should know:

### Arrays and Strings
- Arrays are great for indexed access, while strings are typically handled as arrays of characters.

### Queues and Lists
- Queues are FIFO (First In, First Out), while lists are more flexible in terms of insertions and deletions.

### Linked Lists
- A linked list is useful for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion operations.

### Trees and Tries
- Trees (like binary trees) are useful for hierarchical data. Tries are often used in string searching and prefix matching.

### Hash Maps/Hash Sets
- Hash Maps are efficient for fast lookups, while hash sets are great for ensuring uniqueness of data.

### Graphs
- Graphs are key when working with networks and relations between entities. Understand how to traverse graphs using BFS/DFS.

## System Design and Distributed Systems

Be familiar with the following concepts to answer system design questions:

### Architecture Concepts
- **SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)** and **N-tiered Software Architecture** are fundamental design paradigms for large systems.
- **Resiliency**: Ensure systems can recover from failure.
- **High Availability**: Design systems that ensure uptime even in the event of failures.

### Scalability and Partitioning
- **Auto-Scaling**: Systems should scale with demand.
- **Replication**: Ensure data is duplicated across systems for redundancy.
- **CAP Theorem**: Understand the trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance in distributed systems.

## Computer Networking

Understanding networking protocols is key to many technical interviews, particularly when systems are distributed. Below are important protocols to know:

### Layered Model
- Know the OSI and TCP/IP models, including all seven layers and their respective functions.

### Application-Specific Protocols
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: The fundamental protocols for web communication.
- **TLS**: Security protocol for ensuring data privacy over the internet.

### Network-Level Protocols
- **TCP/IP**: Core protocols for reliable data transmission across the internet.

### Routing Protocols
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** and **ISIS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)**: Know how routing works in large networks.

## Conclusion

Make sure to understand the basic theory, practical use cases, and how to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios. Practice solving problems, explaining your thought process clearly, and working with common tools and frameworks.

Good luck with your interview preparation!
